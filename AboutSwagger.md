# What is Swagger and Why it matters?
Great code is crucial for modern businesses, and the best way for us to connect and share data is through APIs. But not only has there been no industry standard for designing APIs, there hasn't been an industry standard for documenting them.

APIs are supposed to connect engineers and allow for the sharing of great developments. APIs let companies add value to other products and create an ecosystem of shared knowledge. But an API is only valuable if it's accessible. And for that, it needs clear documentation.

Terrible documentation is just as useless as a clock that tells the wrong time. So developers have worked hard to find a way to standardize the vocabulary surrounding APIs. That's where Swagger comes in. Swagger is basically a set of rules (specifications) and tooling for how to semantically describe APIs. Practically, it's a language-agnostic tool that gets everyone on the same page.

# Swagger in a nutshell
Swagger is a framework for describing your API using a common language that everyone can understand.
